## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** 18.x or higher ([Download](https://nodejs.org/))
- **npm** 9.x or higher (comes with Node.js)

### 2. Environment Setup

The application is pre-configured to work with mock data, so you can start it immediately without any backend API. However, if you want to connect to a real backend API in the future:

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory (optional):

```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

REACT_APP_ENABLE_DARK_MODE=true
```

### 3. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will automatically open in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

POST   /api/mentions/search       # Search with filters
GET    /api/analytics/score       # Reputation score
GET    /api/analytics/sentiment   # Sentiment trends
POST   /api/responses/generate    # Generate AI response
GET    /api/alerts                # List alerts
```
